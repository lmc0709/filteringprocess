# SavedData
 This folder containes results of the filtering process code. 
 You can find data collected after the scan matching slam 
and the graph-based slam. The pictures show the end map and 
robot path but you can find more information in the Octave files. 

# Tree structure 
1. First level : name of the data set 
Example
``` 2015-08-19-11-25-05 ```


  2. Second level : pillar radius size 
  Example
  ``` 02 ``` : Pillar radius of 0.2 m 

# File description 
* Data collected after the scan matching slam : 
``` pillar0X_path.txt ```     : Full 2D robot position (x,y).

``` pillar0X.txt ```          : Map (i.e. landmark positiond) computed 
at each time of the scan matching.

``` pillar02_P.png ```        : Picture of the result on [rviz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) where 
the green line represent the robot path and the yellow points are 
the map computed.

* Data collected after the graph-based slam 
``` pillar02_OPTIM_B.g2o ```  : Back-end of the graph before the 
optimzation process

``` pillar02_OPTIM_IG.g2o ``` : Back-end of the graph before the 
optimzation process and after the calculation of the best initial guess.

``` pillar02_OPTIM_A.g2o ```  : Back-end of the graph after the 
optimization process 

``` pillar02_OPTIM_P.png ```  : Picture of the result on [Octave](http://octave.sourceforge.net/index.html) where 
the green line represent the robot path and the yellow points are 
the map computed.
